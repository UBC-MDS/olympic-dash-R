## What Are We Doing?

> “The goal of the Olympic Movement is to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practiced without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play.” 
> 
> -- <cite>International Olympic Committee</cite>

We propose building a visualization app to allow IOC members (and members of the general public) to explore historical Olympic results to review the success trends of various countries to determine abnormal performance trends and which countries could be future high medal achievers. All in the interest of making the olympic games more competitive and reward the countries that are developing their athletes and improving their performance in the games.

## Description of The Dashboard

To explore the current dashboard, please click [here](https://olympic-dash-dsci532-group22-p.herokuapp.com/).

This app contains a dashboard which visualizes Olympic data from 1896 up until 2016. 
Key metrics of interest will be displayed including: 
- Medals earned per country
- Medals earned depending on athlete age
- Athlete height based on Olympic events 
- Medals per country will be displayed 

Medals earned per country will be displayed via a bubble chart accompanied by a 
slider, allowing users to control the year of the Olympics displayed by the graph. 

A bar chart will show the medals earned for each athlete age bracket, while a histogram 
will show the distribution of athlete heights based on the event selected. These figures 
will contain a slider allowing users to adjust athlete age ranges and a dropdown list, 
allowing users to select the event visualized respectively. 

Lastly, a line graph will display the number of medals earned by countries over time. This 
figure will be accompanied by a dropdown list allowing users to select a subset of countries 
to display on the graph. 

Radio buttons on the side of the dashboard will allow for filtering of 
summer/winter Olympics data, in addition to allowing for users to filter data 
by the type of medals. Using these filters, users will be able to investigate trends 
in Olympic success between countries, medal types, athlete demographics, and more.
